# Build splunk-lab-core, which is used as a base for splunk-lab and splunk-lab-ml
#
# The reason for this architecture is so that changes to things like config files
# can be done AFTER the apps in each image are installed, so I don't have to keep
# reinstalling the apps when I'm just tweaking a config file.
#
# Based on https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk/blob/master/enterprise/Dockerfile
#
# I slimmed this down, as I have no desire to run as a separate user, set up a Deployment
# Server, generate PDFs, etc.  All I want to do is run a this single app.
